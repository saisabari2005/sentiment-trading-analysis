# Trading Analysis: Market Sentiment vs Performance

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) and trading performance using historical trading data. The analysis explores how different market sentiment conditions (Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed, Neutral) affect trading outcomes, including:

- Profit and Loss (PnL) performance by sentiment
- Win rates across different market conditions
- Trade size patterns relative to sentiment
- Trading behavior analysis

## Dataset

The analysis uses two main datasets:
1. **Fear & Greed Index Data** (`fear_greed_index.csv`): Contains daily sentiment values and classifications
2. **Historical Trading Data** (`historical_data.csv`): Contains detailed trading records including execution prices, sizes, PnL, and timestamps

## Key Features

- **Sentiment-based Performance Analysis**: Compare trading performance across different market sentiment conditions
- **Win Rate Calculation**: Determine profitability rates for each sentiment classification
- **Trade Size Analysis**: Examine how trade sizes vary with market sentiment
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insightful charts and plots to visualize relationships
